This document is optimized for AI + human onboarding. It explains what the app does, where data lives, and how the main workflows are implemented in code.

---

## 1) What the app does (product mental model)

Digital Vision Board lets users create “boards” and attach “goals” to them. Each goal can have:
- Habits (daily/weekly scheduled completion tracking)
- Tasks (each task has a checklist; checklist items can be completed per-day and can store completion feedback)

Daily loop:
- Open a board
- Open a goal
- Check off habits/tasks (optionally leave a rating + note)
- Review progress/insights

---

## 2) Board types (UIs) and how they map to storage

There are multiple board “canvas” experiences. They differ in how goals are represented and how they are stored.

### A) Freeform “Vision Board” (Canva-like editor)
- Editor: `lib/screens/vision_board_editor_screen.dart`
- Model storage: `VisionBoardComponentsStorageService` (components keyed by boardId)

### B) Goal Canvas (freeform layers over optional background)
- Viewer: `lib/screens/goal_canvas_viewer_screen.dart`
- Editor: `lib/screens/goal_canvas_editor_screen.dart`
- Storage: `lib/services/vision_board_components_storage_service.dart`
- Supports “Layers” UI via `showLayersSheet` (see section 6)

### C) Physical Board (photo background + goal overlays)
- Viewer: `lib/screens/physical_board_viewer_screen.dart`
- Editor: `lib/screens/physical_board_editor_screen.dart`
- Storage:
  - Components: `lib/services/vision_board_components_storage_service.dart`
  - Background image path: `BoardsStorageService.boardImagePathKey(boardId)`
- Goals are `GoalOverlayComponent` anchored in image pixel space (`lib/models/goal_overlay_component.dart`).

### D) Grid Board (structured tile layout)
- Editor: `lib/screens/grid_board_editor.dart`
- Storage: `lib/services/grid_tiles_storage_service.dart` (tiles keyed by boardId)
- Single “goal” viewer: `lib/screens/grid_goal_viewer_screen.dart`

---

## 3) Core data model (what “goal”, “habit”, “task” mean in code)

### VisionComponent (core “node”)
`VisionComponent` is the base type for nodes on freeform canvases.
- Location/size/z-index exist for visuals.
- It also owns the tracker data:
  - `habits: List<HabitItem>`
  - `tasks: List<TaskItem>`

Key files:
- `lib/models/vision_component.dart` (base)
- `lib/models/vision_component_factory.dart` (JSON deserialization)
- `lib/models/vision_components.dart` (exports concrete components)
- `lib/models/image_component.dart` (image goal layer; often has `goal` metadata)
- `lib/models/goal_overlay_component.dart` (physical board goal overlay)

### GridTileModel
Grid boards don’t store `VisionComponent`s directly. They store tiles:
- `lib/models/grid_tile_model.dart`
- Each tile can have: `goal`, `habits`, `tasks`

For tracking UI, `GridGoalViewerScreen` converts a tile into an `ImageComponent` (see section 5).

### HabitItem
`lib/models/habit_item.dart`
- Tracks completion dates / streaks
- Supports weekly schedule gating (`isScheduledOnDate`)
- Stores per-day completion feedback (see below)
- Optional `timeBound: HabitTimeBoundSpec` for timer-based habits
  - Supports two modes: `'time'` (time-based) or `'song'` (song-based)
  - For song-based mode, `duration` represents target number of songs

### TaskItem + ChecklistItem
`lib/models/task_item.dart`
- `TaskItem` owns:
  - `checklist: List<ChecklistItem>`
  - optional task-level completion feedback by date (`completionFeedbackByDate`)
- `ChecklistItem` owns:
  - `completedOn` (YYYY-MM-DD) when checked
  - `feedbackByDate` (per-day checklist-item completion feedback)
  - optional `dueDate` and optional CBT enhancements

Important bug fix: `ChecklistItem.copyWith` uses a sentinel so callers can explicitly clear nullable fields like `completedOn` (unchecking).

---

## 4) Persistence (where data is saved)

### Boards list + board metadata
- `lib/services/boards_storage_service.dart`

### Components (freeform boards: vision board / goal canvas / physical board)
- `lib/services/vision_board_components_storage_service.dart`
- Components are JSON encoded and stored keyed by `boardId`.

### Grid tiles
- `lib/services/grid_tiles_storage_service.dart`
- Tiles are JSON encoded and stored keyed by `boardId`.

---

## 5) The tracker UI: HabitTrackerSheet

Main tracker UI:
- `lib/widgets/habit_tracker_sheet.dart`

Usage patterns:
- Shown as a bottom sheet from viewers (Goal canvas / Physical board viewers).
- Embedded full-screen in `GridGoalViewerScreen` as the whole page body.

Tabs:
- Tracker (habits list)
- Tasks (tasks list + checklist)
- Insights (activity/streak summaries)

It emits updated `VisionComponent` back to the caller via `onComponentUpdated`, and callers persist the updated component list/tile.

---

## 6) Layers UI (showLayersSheet)

Shared “Layers” bottom sheet:
- `lib/widgets/editor/layers_sheet.dart` → `showLayersSheet(...)`

Where it’s used:
- Goal canvas viewer: `GoalCanvasViewerScreen._showLayers` (AppBar button on Canvas tab)
- Physical board viewer: `PhysicalBoardViewerScreen._showLayers` (AppBar button on Photo tab)
  - also supports toggling `isDisabled` (mark completed)
- Grid goal viewer: `GridGoalViewerScreen._showLayers` (top-right overlay button)
  - used to jump between tile-goals without backing out

Selection behavior:
- Selecting a layer updates the viewer’s selected id (highlights it visually).

---

## 7) Rhythmic Timer (Time-Based and Song-Based Modes)

The app supports two timer modes for habits:

### Time-Based Mode
- Traditional timer that tracks accumulated time
- Uses `HabitTimerStateService` for state persistence
- UI: `lib/screens/habit_timer_screen.dart` (existing)
- When target time is reached, automatically marks habit as complete

### Song-Based Mode
- Tracks songs played via music providers (Spotify/Apple Music) or fallback audio player
- Uses `RhythmicTimerService` and `RhythmicTimerStateService` for state management
- Key files:
  - `lib/services/rhythmic_timer_service.dart` - Main service managing timer modes
  - `lib/services/rhythmic_timer_state_service.dart` - State persistence (songsRemaining, currentSongTitle)
  - `lib/services/music_provider_service.dart` - Abstract interface for music providers
  - `lib/models/rhythmic_timer_config.dart` - Configuration model
  - `lib/screens/rhythmic_timer_screen.dart` - UI screen supporting both modes
  - `lib/widgets/rhythmic_timer_widget.dart` - Compact widget for embedding

### Music Provider Integration
- **Spotify**: `SpotifyProvider` in `lib/services/music_provider_service.dart`
  - OAuth integration via backend API (`/api/spotify/*` endpoints)
- **YouTube Music**: `YouTubeMusicProvider` (similar to Spotify, uses backend API `/api/youtube-music/*` endpoints)
- **Local Files**: `LocalFileProvider` (allows users to select audio files from device storage)
  - Requires `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables
  - Connection verification: `_checkSpotifyConnection()` in `music_provider_settings_screen.dart`
  - Settings screen: `lib/screens/music_provider_settings_screen.dart` with pull-to-refresh
  - Error handling: Improved messages for authentication and connection issues
- **Apple Music**: `AppleMusicProvider` (iOS only, uses system APIs)
- **Fallback**: `FallbackAudioProvider` using `audioplayers` package with local assets
- Fallback audio assets: `assets/audio/` directory (created with `.gitkeep`)

### Song-Based Timer Flow
1. User starts timer with song-based habit
2. Service initializes music provider (checks for linked Spotify/Apple Music, falls back to local audio)
3. Listens for track changes via provider SDK or audio player completion events
4. On each track change, decrements `songsRemaining` and updates `currentSongTitle`
5. When `songsRemaining == 0`, triggers `onHabitComplete()` callback
6. Callback marks habit as complete and navigates to Mood Rating screen (CompletionFeedbackSheet)

### Widget Integration
- Android widget (`HabitProgressAppWidget.kt`): Displays song title and count in RemoteViews
- iOS widget (`HabitProgressWidget.swift`): Displays song title and count in WidgetKit view
- Snapshot service includes timer state: `lib/services/habit_progress_widget_snapshot_service.dart`

### Native Platform Code
- Android: `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/digitalvisionboard/app/MusicProviderHandler.kt`
  - **Package name**: Migrated from `com.example.digital_vision_board` to `com.digitalvisionboard.app`
  - Uses MediaSession API to detect currently playing tracks
  - Supports polling fallback for devices without notification listener permission
  - MainActivity: `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/digitalvisionboard/app/MainActivity.kt`
- iOS: `ios/Runner/MusicProviderHandler.swift`
- Method channel: `dvb/music_provider` for track detection
- Spotify OAuth: Handled via backend API, not native SDK

---

## 8) Completion semantics + feedback prompts (unified behavior)

### Habit completion
- Weekly scheduled habits can only be toggled on scheduled dates.
- When toggled ON and feedback is missing for today, prompt for feedback.

### Checklist item completion
- When a checklist item is checked ON:
  - If item feedback missing for today → prompt for feedback.
- If that check causes the task to become fully complete:
  - If task-level feedback missing for today → prompt for task-level feedback.
- Special case: if the task has exactly 1 checklist item, do NOT show two prompts back-to-back.
  - In that case, skip item-level feedback and only ask the task-level “Task completed” feedback.

Shared helpers:
- Mutation / state derivation: `lib/services/completion_mutations.dart`
- Feedback UI: `lib/widgets/dialogs/completion_feedback_sheet.dart` (`showCompletionFeedbackSheet`)

Where completion+feedback is implemented (must stay consistent):
- `lib/widgets/habit_tracker_sheet.dart`
- `lib/screens/tasks_list_screen.dart`
- `lib/widgets/dashboard/all_boards_tasks_tab.dart`
- Habits equivalents:
  - `lib/screens/habits_list_screen.dart`
  - `lib/widgets/dashboard/all_boards_habits_tab.dart`

---

## 9) Add flows (goal picker + creation dialogs)

Goal picker (select goal to attach habit/task to):
- `lib/widgets/dialogs/goal_picker_sheet.dart`

Add/edit dialogs (shared, reused across screens):
- **Goals**: `lib/widgets/dialogs/add_goal_dialog.dart` - Unified dialog for adding/editing goals
  - Used in grid editor for consistent goal creation UI
  - Supports name, category, why important, and deadline fields
  - Provides consistent styling and theme-aware colors
- Habits: `lib/widgets/dialogs/add_habit_dialog.dart`
  - Compact layout is bounded below the status bar (prevents dialog covering notification bar).
- Tasks (full dialog with optional CBT fields): `lib/widgets/dialogs/add_task_dialog.dart`
- Checklist items (due date + optional CBT): `lib/widgets/dialogs/add_checklist_item_dialog.dart`

Global aggregation screens:
- Per-board lists:
  - `lib/screens/habits_list_screen.dart`
  - `lib/screens/tasks_list_screen.dart` (supports adding checklist items inside tasks)
- All-boards dashboard tabs:
  - `lib/widgets/dashboard/all_boards_habits_tab.dart` (Add habit = pick board → pick goal → dialog → save)
  - `lib/widgets/dashboard/all_boards_tasks_tab.dart` (Add task + Add checklist item; same pattern)

---

## 9.5) Wizard flow (create board with recommended goals)

The wizard helps users create boards with recommended goals:
- Entry: `lib/screens/wizard/create_board_wizard_screen.dart`
- Steps:
  1. Board setup: `lib/screens/wizard/wizard_step1_board_setup.dart`
  2. Goals for core values: `lib/screens/wizard/wizard_step_goals_for_core_value.dart`
  3. Grid preview: `lib/screens/wizard/wizard_step3_generate_grid_preview.dart`
  4. Customize grid: `lib/screens/wizard/wizard_step4_customize_grid.dart`

### Recommended Goals with Default Images
- When users add recommended goals in step 2, they can select from AI-generated recommendations via `WizardRecommendationsService`
- In step 4 (`wizard_step4_customize_grid.dart`), before building the board:
  - Default images are automatically fetched for all goals
  - Images are fetched by category using `CategoryImagesService.getCategoryImageUrls()` (preferred)
  - Falls back to `StockImagesService.searchPexelsUrls()` if category images aren't available
  - Images are assigned to goals and passed to `WizardBoardBuilderService.build()` via `defaultImageUrlsByGoalId` parameter
- `WizardBoardBuilderService` (`lib/services/wizard_board_builder.dart`):
  - Accepts optional `defaultImageUrlsByGoalId: Map<String, String>?` parameter
  - When creating grid tiles for goals, uses the provided default image URL if available
  - Default images are stored as URLs (not downloaded/persisted initially) for fast board creation
- Grid editor (`lib/screens/grid_board_editor.dart`):
  - Displays default images (URLs) using `NetworkImage` via `fileImageProviderFromPath()`
  - Users can still search Pexels to replace default images (see section D below)
  - Existing prefill logic (lines 125-159 in `wizard_step4_customize_grid.dart`) remains as a fallback for any tiles that still don't have images

### Image Services
- `CategoryImagesService` (`lib/services/category_images_service.dart`): Fetches curated images by core value + category from backend
- `StockImagesService` (`lib/services/stock_images_service.dart`): Searches Pexels API for images
- Both return image URLs that can be displayed directly or downloaded/persisted later

---

## 10) Viewer-specific behaviors and UX constraints

### PhysicalBoardViewerScreen
- Tapping an overlay opens `HabitTrackerSheet` as a bottom sheet.
- The bottom sheet is constrained so it does not cover the AppBar (max height excludes status+toolbar).

### GridGoalViewerScreen
- The entire screen is a `HabitTrackerSheet` bound to a single `GridTileModel`.
- Uses a `ValueKey(tile.id)` when switching tiles so the sheet remounts cleanly.

---

## 10) Stability / “gotchas” (important for AI edits)

### A) TextEditingController + dialogs
Avoid creating a controller outside a dialog and disposing it immediately after `await showDialog(...)`.
This can crash during route pop animations on some devices (“used after being disposed”).

Example fix:
- `lib/screens/tasks_list_screen.dart` add-task dialog returns a string without an external controller.

### B) Checklist uncheck bug
If you see “can’t uncheck checklist items”, check `ChecklistItem.copyWith` semantics:
- Clearing `completedOn` requires allowing `null` to be passed through (sentinel pattern).
- File: `lib/models/task_item.dart`

### C) Avoid duplicate symbol definitions
Keep shared dialogs/services single-defined. Some files previously contained duplicated class definitions; those were deduped.

---

---

## 13) Dashboard Visualization

The dashboard tab displays vision boards as visual preview cards instead of simple list items.

### VisionBoardPreviewCard
- **File**: `lib/widgets/dashboard/vision_board_preview_card.dart`
- Displays a minified preview of each vision board with:
  - **Grid boards**: Shows up to 9 image tiles in a compact 3x3 grid layout
  - **Other board types**: Shows first available image component, or placeholder with board icon/color
  - Reduced opacity (0.65) for the preview content
  - Board name overlay at bottom with gradient background for readability
  - Edit and delete action buttons in the overlay
  - Active board indicator (highlighted border)

### Preview Rendering
- Uses `FutureBuilder` to asynchronously load board data:
  - Grid boards: `GridTilesStorageService.loadTiles()` to get tiles
  - Other boards: `VisionBoardComponentsStorageService.loadComponents()` to get first image component
- Images are rendered using `fileImageProviderFromPath()` (handles both URLs and local paths)
- Uses `StaggeredGrid.count` with `crossAxisCount: 3` for compact grid display
- Empty tiles show subtle placeholder icons
- Loading state shows circular progress indicator

### Dashboard Tab
- **File**: `lib/widgets/dashboard/dashboard_tab.dart`
- Uses `VisionBoardPreviewCard` in `ListView.builder` instead of `Card` + `ListTile`
- Maintains all existing callbacks (`onOpenEditor`, `onOpenViewer`, `onDeleteBoard`)
- Preserves empty state handling and "New" button
- Includes `PuzzleWidget` at the top of the list for puzzle game access

---

## 15) Puzzle Widget and Game Feature

The app includes a puzzle game feature that turns goal images into interactive 4x4 puzzles (16 pieces).

### Puzzle Service
- **File**: `lib/services/puzzle_service.dart`
- Manages puzzle state and image selection
- Handles automatic 4-hour rotation of puzzle images
- Provides methods to:
  - Get current puzzle image (auto-rotates if 4 hours have passed)
  - Get all available goal images from all boards
  - Manually set puzzle image
  - Get time until next automatic rotation
- Storage: Uses SharedPreferences to persist current image path and last rotation timestamp

### Puzzle Widget
- **File**: `lib/widgets/dashboard/puzzle_widget.dart`
- Displays on dashboard tab as a card widget
- Shows shuffled 4x4 puzzle preview (16 pieces in shuffled state)
- Features:
  - Settings button to manually select puzzle image
  - Tappable to navigate to full puzzle game screen
  - Handles loading and error states
  - Shows "No images available" message when appropriate

### Puzzle Game Screen
- **File**: `lib/screens/puzzle_game_screen.dart`
- Full-screen puzzle solving interface
- Features:
  - Drag-and-drop puzzle pieces (Flutter's `Draggable` and `DragTarget`)
  - 4x4 grid layout (16 pieces)
  - Completion detection with celebration dialog showing solve time
  - Reference image toggle (show/hide original image as overlay)
  - Shuffle button to reshuffle pieces
  - Image selection button to change puzzle image
  - Visual feedback for correct piece placement (highlighted borders)
  - **Animation fix**: Completion tile animation uses clamped opacity values (0.0-1.0) to prevent assertion errors with `Curves.easeOutBack` overshoot

### Puzzle Image Splitter
- **File**: `lib/utils/puzzle_image_splitter.dart`
- Utility to split images into puzzle pieces
- Uses `image` package (`package:image/image.dart`) for image manipulation
- Supports both local file paths and network URLs
- Splits image into 4x4 grid (16 equal pieces)
- Provides shuffle functionality for piece indices

### Puzzle Image Selector
- **File**: `lib/widgets/dialogs/puzzle_image_selector_sheet.dart`
- Bottom sheet dialog for manually selecting puzzle image
- Shows all available goal images from all boards in a grid
- Displays current puzzle image with checkmark indicator
- Images are loaded from:
  - Grid boards: `GridTilesStorageService` (image tiles)
  - Other boards: `VisionBoardComponentsStorageService` (ImageComponent instances)

### Integration Points
- **Dashboard Tab**: `lib/widgets/dashboard/dashboard_tab.dart`
  - `PuzzleWidget` is displayed at the top of the board list
- **Dashboard Drawer**: `lib/screens/dashboard_screen.dart`
  - "Puzzle Game" menu item added to drawer (after Settings)
  - Opens puzzle game with current puzzle image
  - Shows snackbar if no images are available

### Data Flow
1. Puzzle widget loads current image from `PuzzleService`
2. Service checks if 4 hours have passed since last rotation
3. If yes, automatically selects random image from available goal images
4. Image is split into 16 pieces using `PuzzleImageSplitter`
5. Pieces are shuffled and displayed in widget
6. Tapping widget navigates to `PuzzleGameScreen`
7. User can drag and drop pieces to solve puzzle
8. Completion is detected when all pieces are in correct positions

### Key Implementation Details
- Puzzle pieces are stored as `Uint8List` (PNG-encoded image bytes)
- Uses Flutter's built-in drag-and-drop APIs (`Draggable`, `DragTarget`)
- Puzzle state (piece positions) is managed in widget state
- Completion detection checks if `piecePositions[i] == i` for all pieces
- Timer tracks solve time from puzzle start to completion
- Images are loaded using `fileImageProviderFromPath()` utility (handles URLs and local paths)

## 16) Typography and Theme System

### Typography System
The app uses a standardized typography system defined in `lib/utils/app_typography.dart`:
- `AppTypography.heading1(context)` - 24sp, bold - Main screen titles
- `AppTypography.heading2(context)` - 20sp, semi-bold - Section titles
- `AppTypography.heading3(context)` - 18sp, semi-bold - Subsection titles and card titles
- `AppTypography.body(context)` - 16sp, regular - Main content text
- `AppTypography.bodySmall(context)` - 14sp, regular - Secondary content
- `AppTypography.caption(context)` - 12sp, regular - Captions, hints, metadata
- `AppTypography.button(context)` - 16sp, medium - Button text
- `AppTypography.secondary(context)` - 14sp, regular - Less prominent text (uses onSurfaceVariant)
- `AppTypography.error(context)` - 14sp, regular - Error text (uses error color)

All typography styles use theme-aware colors that adapt to light/dark mode.

### Theme Colors Guidelines
The app uses Material 3 theming with proper light/dark mode support:
- **Never use hardcoded colors** like `Colors.black54`, `Colors.grey`, `Colors.white`, etc.
- **Always use theme colors** from `Theme.of(context).colorScheme`:
  - `colorScheme.onSurface` - Primary text color
  - `colorScheme.onSurfaceVariant` - Secondary text color (replaces `Colors.grey`, `Colors.black54`)
  - `colorScheme.outline.withOpacity(0.12)` - Borders and dividers (replaces `Colors.black12`)
  - `colorScheme.error` - Error states (replaces `Colors.red`)
  - `colorScheme.primary` - Primary actions and highlights
  - `colorScheme.surface` - Background surfaces
  - `colorScheme.tertiary` / `colorScheme.tertiaryContainer` - Accent colors (replaces `Colors.orange`, `Colors.green.shade200`)

### Text Alignment
- Use consistent text alignment across screens
- Dialog titles and content should be left-aligned by default
- Center alignment should be used sparingly (e.g., empty states, centered buttons)
- Form fields should be left-aligned with proper labels

### Theme Configuration
Theme is configured in `lib/main.dart` with:
- Light theme: `ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.deepPurple, brightness: Brightness.light)`
- Dark theme: `ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.deepPurple, brightness: Brightness.dark)`
- Text theme with standardized font sizes and weights
- Material 3 enabled for modern UI components

## 18) Build Configuration and Environment Variables

### Build Configuration
- **Icon Tree-Shaking**: Build uses `--no-tree-shake-icons` flag to support dynamic IconData instances
  - Helper function: `IconService.iconFromCodePoint()` in `lib/services/icon_service.dart`
  - Used in: `routine_editor_screen.dart`, `routine_execution_screen.dart`, `routine_preview_card.dart`
  - Reason: Routines/todos store icon code points dynamically, so Flutter can't tree-shake at compile time

### Environment Variables
Backend requires these environment variables (see `ENV_SETUP.md` for full list):
- **Core**: `PORT`, `BASE_URL`
- **Spotify OAuth** (required for Spotify integration):
  - `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` - Spotify app client ID from [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
  - `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` - Spotify app client secret
  - `SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI` - OAuth callback URL (defaults to `${BASE_URL}/auth/spotify/callback`)
  - `SPOTIFY_SCOPES` - OAuth scopes (default: `user-read-private user-read-email playlist-read-private playlist-read-collaborative user-library-read`)
- **Database**: `DATABASE_URL` (optional, uses JSON file storage if not set)
- **Other**: `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `PEXELS_API_KEY`, `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` (all optional)

### Spotify Integration Flow
1. User navigates to Settings → Music Provider Settings
2. Taps "Connect" button for Spotify
3. Backend generates OAuth URL with PKCE challenge
4. User completes OAuth in browser
5. Backend stores tokens in database (`dv_users.spotify_*` columns)
6. Settings screen verifies connection via test API call
7. User can now access playlists and search tracks

### Error Handling
- **Authentication errors**: Clear messages prompting user to log in or connect Spotify
- **Connection errors**: Settings screen shows connection status and "Connect" button when needed
- **API errors**: Proper error messages distinguish between "not logged in" vs "Spotify not connected"

### Privacy Policy
- **Backend route**: `GET /privacy-policy` - Serves a standalone HTML privacy policy page
- **Purpose**: Required by Google Play Console for apps using sensitive permissions (CAMERA, LOCATION, etc.)
- **Content**: Explains data collection, storage, permissions, and user rights
- **Canva App Panel**: Links to `/privacy-policy` route instead of anchor link for separate URL
- **Location**: `backend/src/server.js` - Privacy policy route serves HTML with styling

## 17) Glossary (UI term → code type)

- Board:
  - `VisionBoardInfo` (`lib/models/vision_board_info.dart`) + persisted via `BoardsStorageService`
- Goal (general concept: something you attach habits/tasks to):
  - Freeform/goal canvas: usually an `ImageComponent` with `goal` metadata
  - Physical board: `GoalOverlayComponent`
  - Grid: `GridTileModel` (converted to `ImageComponent` for tracker UI)
- Layer:
  - A `VisionComponent` entry in the board’s components list (ordered by `zIndex`)
  - Managed via `showLayersSheet` in `lib/widgets/editor/layers_sheet.dart`
- Habit:
  - `HabitItem` (`lib/models/habit_item.dart`) stored on a goal’s component/tile
- Task:
  - `TaskItem` (`lib/models/task_item.dart`) stored on a goal’s component/tile
- Checklist item:
  - `ChecklistItem` (`lib/models/task_item.dart`)
  - Completion stored in `completedOn` (YYYY-MM-DD) and per-day feedback in `feedbackByDate`
- “Tracker”:
  - The per-goal tracking UI: `HabitTrackerSheet` (`lib/widgets/habit_tracker_sheet.dart`)
